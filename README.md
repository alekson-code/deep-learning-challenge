# Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
# For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

# The report should contain the following:

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

# Data Preprocessing
# What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
## X_train: This variable typically holds the input features used to train the model. 
## It is usually a two-dimensional array or DataFrame where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.
## y_train: This is the corresponding target variable (dependent variable) for the training dataset, which contains the labels 
## or outcomes that the model is trying to predict.
## The training dataset is used to fit the model so that it can learn the relationships between the features and the target variable. 
## After training, the model can then be evaluated using a separate testing dataset (often referred to as X_test and y_test).
# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

# Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
